# file globbing

## Mixing globs
Now, let's put the previous levels together! We put a few happy, but diversely-named files in /challenge/files. Go cd there and, using the globbing you've learned, write a single, short (6 characters or less) glob that (when passed as an argument to /challenge/run) will match the files "challenging", "educational", and "pwning"!


### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{MLa0VdcWYA6p8XzjHlwWHvwPH4l.QX1IDO0wSMzAzNzEzW}`

just followed the description and got the flag
got the path from the terminal itself


```bash
cd /challenge/files
/challenge/run [pce]*
```

### New Learnings
learnt to write and use paths on the terminal

### References 
none
