# digesting documentation

## Helpful Programs
Some programs don't have a man page, but might tell you how to run them if invoked with a special argument. Usually, this argument is --help, but it can often be -h or, in rare cases, -?, help, or other esoteric values like /? (though that latter is more frequently encountered on Windows).

In this level, you will practice reading a program's documentation with --help. Try it out!

### Solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{UxFRBM8Iev_OJ6QUOCRKEOsn0P_.QX3IDO0wSMzAzNzEzW}`

just followed the description and got the flag
got the path from the terminal itself
read help page and identified the -p condition
read -p page and got the flag

```bash
cd /
/challenge/challenge --help
/challenge/challenge -p
/challenge/challenge -g 860
```

### New Learnings
learnt to write and use paths on the terminal
