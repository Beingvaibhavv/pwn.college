# Comprehending Commands

## hidden files
Interestingly, ls doesn't list all the files by default. Linux has a convention where files that start with a . don't show up by default in ls and in a few other contexts. To view them with ls, you need to invoke ls with the -a flag, as so:

hacker@dojo:~$ touch pwn
hacker@dojo:~$ touch .college
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
pwn
hacker@dojo:~$ ls -a
.college	pwn
hacker@dojo:~$
Now, it's your turn! Go find the flag, hidden as a dot-prepended file in /.


### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0g_ySPtHAMpUfSwW0-22LvszvcP.QXwUDO0wSMzAzNzEzW}`

just followed the description and got the flag
got the path from the terminal itself
used ls -a to get the flag


```bash
cd /
ls -a
cat .flag-8848162991640
```

### New Learnings
learnt to write and use paths on the terminal
used ls -a command to move files and get the flag
