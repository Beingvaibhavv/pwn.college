# Comprehending Commands

## more catting practice
You can specify all sorts of paths as arguments to commands, and we'll practice some more with cat. In this level, I'll put the flag in some crazy directory, and I will not allow you to change directories with cd, so no cat flag for you. You must retrieve the flag by absolute path, wherever it is.

### Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{4YLxSVcAMrAU-yCzHLvGgfjOSEh.QXwITO0wSMzAzNzEzW}

just followed the description and got the flag
got the path from the terminal itself
used cat command


```bash
ls
cat /usr/include/linux/flag
```

### New Learnings
learnt to write and use paths on the terminal
used cat command to capture the flag

### References
