# Comprehending Commands

## removing files
Files are all around you. Like candy wrappers, there'll eventually be too many of them. In this level, we'll learn to clean up!

In Linux, you remove files with the rm command, as so:

hacker@dojo:~$ touch PWN
hacker@dojo:~$ touch COLLEGE
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
COLLEGE     PWN
hacker@dojo:~$ rm PWN
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
COLLEGE
hacker@dojo:~$
Let's practice. This challenge will create a delete_me file in your home directory! Delete it, then run /challenge/check, which will make sure you've deleted it and then give you the flag!


### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{omBJfeWriB94WDuHvYFjWRlpLed.QX2kDM1wSMzAzNzEzW}`

just followed the description and got the flag
got the path from the terminal itself
deleted the file from the home directory using rm command


```bash
cd home
cd hacker
rm delete_me
cd /
/challenge/check
```

### New Learnings
learnt to write and use paths on the terminal
used rm command to delete files and get the flag
